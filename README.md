# ApexIOTgatewaySimulation
This is a simulation of an application developed using Apache Apex for intelligent IOT gateways demonstrating the low level analytics, data filtering and aggregation that can be performed at these gateways where the memory and the resources are very limited. This application will be executed in a new mode similar to the "local mode" of Apex where there is no Yarn or HDFS and supports a non-distributed environment.
A lot more needs to be done as far as the productization of this mode is concerned as it is simply a simulation and the first prototype.

Uses Hadoop, Apache Apex, Malhar library, java.
