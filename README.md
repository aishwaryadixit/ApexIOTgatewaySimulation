# ApexIOTgatewaySimulation
This is a simulation of an application developed using Apache Apex for intelligent IOT gateways demonstrating the kind of low level analytics, data filtering and aggregation that can be performed at these gateways where the memory and the resources are very limited. This application will be run in a new mode similar to the local mode of Apex where there is no Yarn or HDFS and supports a non-distributed environment.
A lot more needs to be done as far as the productisation of this mode is concerned as it is under development(Refer the IOTDevMode rep for this). Work is still in progress.


Uses Hadoop, Apache Apex, Malhar library, java.
